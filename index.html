                    <h2>Lincoln, NE</h2>
                    <p>In 2014 I took a three week road trip vacation! It was the longest and best trip I have ever taken. I started from St. Louis and went to many locations in the western United States. First stop was Lincoln, Nebraska. My road trip buddy has family there and it was a convenient stop along the way. Lincoln is a small town, but full of great people and I actually lived there for a few years after this trip. We got stuck behind an Amish family in a horse and buggy upon entering Nebraska.</p>

                    <a name="Denver"></a>
                    <h2>Denver, CO</h2>
                    <p>After a couple days in Lincoln, the next stop up was Denver, Colorado! We arrived in the night with no visibility of the mountains, so waking up the next morning and seeing what was around us was breathtaking. We did some hiking and sightseeing.</p>

                    <a name="Vegas"></a>
                    <h2>Las Vegas, NV</h2>
                    <p>After leaving Colorado, we made our way to Las Vegas! We actually stayed in a town called Mesquite, a bit outside of Las Vegas. We didn't spend much time in Vegas itself(we arrived during a big fight night weekend and the city was extremely crowded and traffic was awful). But it was a great time nonetheless.</p>

                    <a name="Cali"></a>
                    <h2>California</h2>
                    <p>Next up, we made our way to our goal: California. We spent the most time of the trip in multiple cities here. We spent time in San Diego, Los Angelos, and San Francisco. It was my first time ever going to the Pacific Ocean and it was a blast. Can&apos;t wait to go back!</p>

                    <a name="Portland"></a>
                    <h2>Portland, OR</h2>
                    <p>When we finally decided to leave California, we were'nt ready to head home yet. So we decided to make our way up to Seattle. We certainly wanted to stop in Portland, though. Especially after entering Oregon. Out of all of the beautiful sights I had seen thus far, I believe Oregon had the most beautiful scenery.</p>

                    <a name="Seattle"></a>
                    <h2>Seattle, WA</h2>
                    <p>Our final stop on our trip was in Seattle before we headed back to St. Louis. It was extremely hilly as we approached the pier area. Unbelievably, I don't recall it raining at all while we were there, which was a bit unexpected. This trip was amazingly fun, but it was time to head home.</p>
